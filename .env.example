# DATABASE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Neon PostgreSQL Connection String
# Format: postgresql://[user]:[password]@[endpoint].[region].neon.tech/[database]?sslmode=require
# Get your connection string from: https://console.neon.tech/app/projects
#
# For local development, use the DEVELOPMENT BRANCH connection string
# IMPORTANT: Use "neondb_owner" role (default admin role created with your project)
# Database name is "neondb" (Neon's default), branch identified by endpoint
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:your_password@ep-dev-xxx.aws-sa-east-1.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local:
#    cp .env.example .env.local
#
# 2. Get your Neon development branch connection string:
#    - Navigate to: https://console.neon.tech
#    - Select your project: role-directory
#    - Go to "Branches" tab
#    - Click on your "development" branch
#    - Copy the connection string from "Connection Details"
#    - The string should include "neondb_owner" as the role
#
# 3. Replace the DATABASE_URL value above with your actual connection string
#
# 4. Verify the connection string includes:
#    ✓ Role: neondb_owner (default admin role, NOT a custom user)
#    ✓ Password from Neon Console
#    ✓ Correct endpoint for development branch (ep-dev-xxx or similar)
#    ✓ Correct region (aws-sa-east-1 for São Paulo)
#    ✓ Database name: neondb (Neon's default database name)
#    ✓ SSL mode: ?sslmode=require (REQUIRED)
#
# 5. Test the connection:
#    psql "$DATABASE_URL"
#
# 6. Start your local development server:
#    npm run dev
#
# =============================================================================
# ABOUT neondb_owner ROLE
# =============================================================================
#
# neondb_owner is the default Postgres role created with your Neon project.
# This role:
# - Owns the "neondb" database
# - Is a member of "neon_superuser" (admin privileges)
# - Has CREATEDB, CREATEROLE, BYPASSRLS permissions
# - Has full read/write access to all data
#
# For production, you may want to create separate roles with limited privileges.

# =============================================================================
#
# ⚠️  NEVER commit .env.local to git
# ⚠️  NEVER share your DATABASE_URL publicly
# ⚠️  NEVER commit actual credentials to this .env.example file
# ⚠️  Always use sslmode=require for Neon connections
