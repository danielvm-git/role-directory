# Out of Scope for MVP

**Explicitly NOT included to maintain focus on infrastructure validation:**

❌ **Multiple dashboard pages** - ONE page (Hello World) is sufficient to prove the stack  
❌ **Custom authentication system** - Using Neon Auth instead (faster, more robust)  
❌ **Automated testing in CI/CD** - Lint + Type Check + Build only; tests added in Phase 2  
❌ **File system access validation** - Deferred to Phase 4 (workflow/sprint status pages)  
❌ **Monitoring and alerting** - Basic Cloud Run logging sufficient initially  
❌ **Email notifications** - Not needed for MVP validation  
❌ **Advanced permissions/roles** - Email whitelist sufficient for MVP  
❌ **Role/pricing feature development** - Database exists but features deferred  
❌ **UI polish or design** - Functional only; aesthetics deferred  
❌ **SEO, analytics, or marketing** - OAuth-only access, no public discovery needed
